# rsDenoise
A python-based, customisable and extensible pipeline for resting-state fMRI data.<br>
Authors: Paola Galdi (paola.galdi@gmail.com) and Julien Dubois (jcrdubois@gmail.com).<br>
The software is provided as is without warranty of any kind.


This configurable pipeline for the processing of resting-state fMRI was originally designed to work with data from the Human Connectome Project (and hence the [HCP directory structure](https://wiki.humanconnectome.org/display/PublicData/How+To+Handle+Downloaded+HCP+Data "HCP directory structure")). The original code is still available [here](https://github.com/adolphslab/HCP_MRI-behavior "HCP_MRI-behavior"). The pipeline was first updated to work with data that are converted to an HCP-like format, using [ciftify](https://github.com/edickie/ciftify "ciftify"), and later extended to work with data minimally preprocessed with [fmriprep](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/ "fmriprep"). 

The pipeline works with both volumetric (NIFTI) and surface data (either CIFTI or GIFTI).

All functions needed for processing are grouped in three helpers file:
- `HCP_helpers.py` contains the set of functions to work with the HCP directory structure
- `fmriprepciftify_helpers.py` is meant to work with data previously processed with fmriprep and freesurfer, converted to HCP-like structure with ciftify
- `fmriprep_helpers.py` is designed to work directly with fmriprep outputs, with or without freesurfer outputs

The IPython notebooks provide a few examples of use (more can be found here: [HCP_MRI-behavior](https://github.com/adolphslab/HCP_MRI-behavior "HCP_MRI-behavior"))
A minimal script to launch the pipeline is provided in `runPipeline_example.py`. A command line wrapper is provided in `rsDenoise.py`.
Example output for a HCP subject [here](https://caltech.box.com/s/t7zaw05wcnudl7b2jvn69wa2fvzlcc4j "outputs,preGLM0 pipeline").

## Overview

### Prerequisites
The code depends on a set of python libraries, including: scipy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels, numpy, nibabel, nilearn, nipype, seaborn, scikit_learn.

### Preprocessing Pipeline
Preprocessing is performed by executing a sequence of steps or operations, each of which corresponds to a function in the helpers file. There are 7 available operations: [Voxel Normalization](#voxel-normalization), [Detrending](#detrending), [Motion Regression](#motion-regression), [Scrubbing](#voxel-normalization), [Tissue Regression](#tissue-regression), [Global Signal Regression](#global-signal-regression) and [Temporal Filtering](#temporal-filtering). The corresponding functions are built using the following template:

` def OperationName(niiImg, flavor, masks, imgInfo):`

* <b>niiImg</b> it is a list of two elements `[data,volData]`. If the file to be processes is a Nifti file, the variable `data` contains Nifti data and the variable `volData` is `None`. If the input file is a Cifti file, the variable `data` contains Cifti data and the variable `volData` contains volumetric data. Image data can be loaded with function `load_img()`.
* <b>flavor</b> is a list containing the Operation parameters (detailed in the [following section](#pipeline-operations)).
* <b>masks</b> is the output of the function `makeTissueMasks()`, a list of four elements corresponding to 1) whole brain mask, 2) white matter mask, 3) cerebrospinal fluid mask and 4) gray matter mask. 
* <b>imgInfo</b> is a list of 6 elements corresponding to 1) no. of rows in a slice, 2) no. of columns in a slice, 3) no. of slices, 4) no. of time points, 5) the affine matrix and 6) repetion time. These data can be retrieved with function `load_img()`.

A preprocessing pipeline can be fully described with the following data structure:

```
[
    ['Operation1',  1, [param1]],
    ['Operation2',  2, [param1, param2, param3]],
    ['Operation3',  3, [param1, param2]],
    ['Operation4',  4, [param1]],
    ['Operation5',  5, [param1, param2]],
    ['Operation6',  6, [param1, param2, param3]],
    ['Operation7',  7, [param]]
]
```
It is a list of structures. Each structure is a list of 3 elements:
1. The operation name.
2. The operation order.
3. The list of parameters for the specific operation.

Operations are executed following the operation order specified by the user. Note that in case of regression operations, a single regression step combining multiple regressors (e.g., tissue regressors and global signal regressor) can be requested by assigning the same order to all regression steps.

There are several pipelines already specified helpers file:

```
config.operationDict = {
    'A': [ #Finn et al. 2015

        ['Detrending',              6, ['legendre', 3 ,'GM']],
        ['GlobalSignalRegression',  7, ['GS']]
        ],

        ['TissueRegression',        4, ['WMCSF+dt+sq', 'wholebrain']],
        ['GlobalSignalRegression',  4, ['GS+dt+sq']],
        ['Scrubbing',               4, ['RMS', 0.25]]
        ],
    'C': [ #Siegel et al. 2016 (SiegelB)
        ['VoxelNormalization',      1, ['demean']],
        ['Detrending',              2, ['poly', 1, 'wholebrain']],
        ['TissueRegression',        3, ['CompCor', 5, 'WMCSF', 'wholebrain']],
        ['TissueRegression',        3, ['GM', 'wholebrain']], 
        ['GlobalSignalRegression',  3, ['GS']],
        ['MotionRegression',        3, ['censoring']],
        ['Scrubbing',               3, ['FD+DVARS', 0.25, 5]], 
        ['TemporalFiltering',       4, ['Butter', 0.009, 0.08]]
        ],
        ...
    }
```

### Pipeline Operations
Custom operations can be provided by users, using the template detailed above. New functions need to be added to the Hooks data structure in the helpers file:

```
Hooks={
   'MotionRegression'       : MotionRegression,
   'Scrubbing'              : Scrubbing,
   'TissueRegression'       : TissueRegression,
   'Detrending'             : Detrending,
   'TemporalFiltering'      : TemporalFiltering, 
   'GlobalSignalRegression' : GlobalSignalRegression, 
   'VoxelNormalization'     : VoxelNormalization,
   'newFunction'            : newFunction,
   }
```

In the following we detail those included in the helpers file.

#### Voxel Normalization
* <b>zscore:</b> convert each voxel’s time course to z-score (remove mean, divide by standard deviation).
* <b>demean:</b> substract the mean from each voxel's time series.
* <b>pcSigCh:</b> convert each voxel’s time course to % signal change (remove mean, divide by mean, multiply by 100)

Example: `['VoxelNormalization',      1, ['zscore']]`
#### Detrending

#### Motion Regression 
Note: R = [X Y Z pitch yaw roll]<br>
Note: if temporal filtering has already been performed, the motion regressors are filtered too. <br>
Note: if scrubbing has been requested, a regressor is added for each volume to be censored; the censoring option performs only scrubbing.
* <b>R:</b> translational and rotational realignment parameters (R) are used as explanatory variables in motion regression.
* <b>R dR:</b> translational and rotational realignment parameters (R) and their temporal derivatives (dR) are used as explanatory variables in motion regression.

* <b>R dR R^2 dR^2:</b> realignment parameters (R) with their derivatives (dR), quadratic terms (R^2) and square of derivatives (dR^2) are used in motion regression.
* <b>R R^2 R-1 R-1^2:</b> realignment parameters at time t (R) and realignment parameters at time t-1 (R-1) with their square terms are used in motion regression.
* <b>R R^2 R-1 R-1^2 R-2 R-2^2:</b> realignment parameters at time t (R), t-1 (R-1) and t-2 (R-2) with their square terms are used in motion regression.
* <b>censoring:</b> for each volume tagged for scrubbing, a unit impulse function  with a value of 1 at that time point and 0 elsewhere is included as a regressor.
* <b>ICA-AROMA:</b> ICA is used to identify noise components that are used as regressors.

Example: `['MotionRegression',      3, ['R dR']]`
#### Scrubbing
Note: this step only flags the volumes to be censored, that are then regressed out in the MotionRegression step.<br>
Note: uncensored segments of data lasting fewer than 5 contiguous volumes, are flagged for removal as well.
* <b>FD</b>
	1. Specify a threshold for framewise displacement (FD) in mm.
	2. Specify number of adjacent volumes to exclude (optional).

	2. Specify a threshold <i>t</i> s.t. volumes with a variance of differentiated signal (DVARS) greater than (100 + <i>t</i>)% of the run median DVARS are flagged for removal (as in Siegel et al, Cerebral Cortex, 2016).
	3. Specify number of adjacent volumes to exclude (optional).
* <b>RMS</b>
	1. Specify threshold for root mean square displacement in mm.
	2. Specify number of adjacent volumes to exclude (optional).
